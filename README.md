# Various stuff for our in-person participants

## announced on Monday:
- if you don't want your photos published (e.g., on ICAPS's X account), let us know ASAP as we might send them some soon.
- (updated regularly)

## announced on Sunday:
- You were all invited to join our slack. Please join! People use it to coordinate getting out :) an we use it for some quick info.
- Breakfast is from 7 am. Make sure to come early enough given our program constraints.
- Don't forget your slide! (See below.)
- You need your badges to be allowed entry for breakfast, lunch, etc. You should have received them in the checkin (and can still get them there).

# Zoom links for lectures and labs:

Note that talks will be recorded, so please make sure to disable video and microphone. Only enable if, at the end, you want to ask questions.

# ICKEPS

The ICKEPS organizers provided the file [ICKEPS-info.md](./ICKEPS-info.md) with important information. Please check it out!

# Social

- Just a kind reminder to please edit our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XOz9zGJTVUv9RY0koI6K-hBi2MryxuP2iOrX5KySITs/edit) to add a slide with some information about you. The presentation will be shared with all participants during the first day so that we can get to know everyone. We let you decide what to include (and of course whether you want to add *any* slide at all), but please stick to one slide (and please include your photo).
- We created a channel on the Planning Community slack workspace. Joining is voluntary, but we'd love for everybody to be in that channel.

# Running the Tutorials
The tutorials are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, suitable for running online via Google Colab. Basic knowledge of Python and PDDL is required.
All necessary installations are performed when running the first few cells of each notebook.
The notebooks can be found here:
https://github.com/CLAIR-LAB-TECHNION/ICAPS-24/tree/main/notebooks
At the beginning of each notebook, there is a link to run it on Colab.

If you would like to run the notebooks locally on your machine, you can download them, but some installations may be required (e.g., numpy).
